# Overview

Bananasign APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization.

To begin, obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the [Bananasign Developer API](https://app-auth-staging.bananasign.co/settings/api). Then your client application can requests an access token from the Lumin PDF Authorization Server.
