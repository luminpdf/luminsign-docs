Lumin Sign Events (aka "webhooks), which are payloads of event metadata automatically sent to your app when something happens in Lumin Sign.

## Account callbacks

**Account Callbacks** notify your app when an event happens involving your account by sending the event payload to your account callback url.

The **Account Callbacks** can be configured on the [Developer Settings page](https://sign-staging.luminpdf.com/developer/configuration).

## Callback Request

### Event Payload

Event payloads always include an *event* field, which contains basic information about the event that occurred.

Event payloads may include information about the event occurred:

```js
{
  "event" : {
    "event_time": 1694664207595,
    "event_type": "signature_request_sent", //  the name of the specific event that occurred
    ...
  },
  "signature_request": {
    "signature_request_id": "fa5c8a0b0f492d768749333ad6fcc214c111e967",
    "title": "My first request",
    "is_complete": false,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Securing Callbacks

### Signature Verification

We provide a couple of headers on callback requests:

**User-Agent**: Sender agent. Always `Lumin Sign API`

**X-Signature**: A base64 encoded SHA256 signature of the request's JSON payload, generated using your [Primary API key](/docs/api/authentication/#multiple-api-keys)

```bash title="Example X-Signature"
api_key='my_primary_api_key'
json='{"event": { "event_time": 1694664207595, "event_type": "signature_request_sent" }, "signature_request": { "signature_request_id": "fa5c8a0b0f492d768749333ad6fcc214c111e967", "title": "My first request" } }'

echo -n $json | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $api_key | base64 (X-Signature = MzgxMGNiNDExMDQxZWZhYjI3OWQzMTY5OGI5NTg0MzcyZTVlZGU5ZDE2NDFmYmIzNTQ4MTBmMTZlNTFiZTgxYwo=)
```

## Failures and Retries

Our requests will timeout after 30 seconds, so callbacks will fail if your server takes longer than that to respond.

Retry policy will be updated later.
