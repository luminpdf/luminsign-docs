# Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to automatically react to events in Lumin, eliminating the need for continuous API polling. **Lumin** pushes real-time notifications to your system when key events occur, such as a **signature request being approved** or a **document being ready for download**.

When a webhook event is triggered, Lumin sends an **HTTP POST request** with a JSON payload to your specified webhook endpoint. Your receiving application can then use this information to run business logic, trigger workflows, or store records.

## Types of webhooks in Lumin

Lumin currently supports **Account-level webhooks**
    - Configured once at the **Workspace level** (Workspace Owner sets it under **API Key → Account callback**).
    - Covers all users and events in the Workspace, **independent of which API key or user initiated them**.
    - Events (e.g., `signature_request_created`, `signature_request_viewed`) are always validated using the **Primary API key**.
    - **Use case**: Internal tools, single-tenant systems, full Workspace monitoring.

## How the event flow works

Most webhook integrations follow this general pattern:

1. **User action triggers an event:** Something happens in Lumin — e.g., a user sends a signature request.
2. **Lumin sends a notification:** Lumin POSTS a JSON payload to your webhook endpoint describing the event.
3. **Your server acknowledges:** Your endpoint returns an HTTP `200 OK` to confirm receipt.
4. **Your logic runs:** Your system decides how to respond — e.g., send an internal notification, update CRM data, or archive documents.
5. **Additional API calls (if needed):** Your server can call Lumin APIs to fetch more details or take follow-up actions.

### Example: Signature request workflow

Let's walk through a signature request scenario:

1. A user creates and sends a **signature request** in Lumin Sign.
2. All required signers complete the signing process.
3. Lumin sends a `signature_request_approved` webhook event to your endpoint.
4. Your server responds with `200 OK` to confirm receipt.
5. Your app then calls `GET /signature_request/{id}/file` to download the **Certificate of Completion** and the **signed PDF**, storing them securely in your system.

With webhooks, your app can do things beyond just receiving events:
- Automate document workflows as soon as events occur.
- Keep external systems (like Salesforce, HubSpot, or internal CRMs) up to date.
- Notify team members or customers in real-time.
- Archive and track compliance documents immediately after completion.

## Event types and Retry rules

### Supported event types

Lumin supports the following webhook events across both webhook types:

| Event Name | Description | Attached API Object |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `signature_request_created` | The signature request is created successfully | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_viewed` | A signer opens the document | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_approved` | The document has been signed by all signers | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_declined` | A signer declines the document. This will turn the `status` of the `signature_request` to `REJECTED` | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_signed` | The document has been signed by a signer | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_downloadable` | The signed document and/or certificate of completion is ready for download | [Signature Request](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_invalid` | An error occurred while processing the signature request data on our back-end i.e. invalid text tags | [Signature Request Error](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_canceled` | The signature request is canceled | [Signature Request Error](/api/get-signature-request/) |
| `signature_request_cancel_failed` | The signature request cancelation failed | [Signature Request Error](/api/get-signature-request/) |

### Event payload structure

All webhook events follow this consistent structure:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "event_time": 1758812586180,
    "event_type": "signature_request_downloadable",
    "event_metadata": {
      "workspace_id": "68d417dcdeaecfae84872de8"
    }
  },
  "signature_request": {
    "signature_request_id": "68d558daa153cb3c30718518",
    "title": "Test webhook",
    "created_at": 1758812378277,
    "updated_at": 1758812574883,
    "expires_at": 1827510980694,
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "signers": [
      {
        "name": "Thu Le",
        "email": "thula@luminpdf.com",
        "status": "APPROVED",
        "is_approved": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "details_url": "https://sign.luminpdf.com/auth?mode=view-contract&token=..."
}
```

### Retry rules and failure handling

Our webhook delivery system implements robust retry mechanisms to ensure reliable event delivery:

#### Retry schedule
| Retry Attempt | Delay After Previous Attempt |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| First         | 5 minutes                    |
| Second        | 15 minutes                   |
| Third         | 45 minutes                   |
| Fourth        | 2 hours 15 minutes           |
| Fifth         | 6 hours 45 minutes           |
| Sixth         | 20 hours 15 minutes           |

#### Failure conditions
- **Timeout**: Requests timeout after 30 seconds
- **HTTP Errors**: Any non-200 response status
- **Connection Failures**: Network connectivity issues

#### Best practices for webhook handling
- **Respond quickly**: Keep response times under 30 seconds
- **Return HTTP 200**: Acknowledge receipt with success status
- **Implement idempotency**: Handle duplicate events gracefully
- **Log all events**: Maintain audit trails for debugging
- **Verify signatures**: Always validate webhook authenticity

## Event subscription rules

**By default, Account webhook URLs subscribe to all supported events automatically** - there's no opt-out mechanism.
