# Account Webhooks

The **account-level webhook** notifies you of events happening across your entire Workspace. It is configured under your Workspace’s Developer Settings and secured with your Primary API key.

This model is best for **single-tenant integrations**, such as internal tools, where a Workspace admin wants centralized visibility of all activity.

## Setting up Account webhooks
:::info
Only the **Workspace Owner** can create or update the Webhook URL.
:::

To configure Account webhooks:

1. Go to **Developer Settings page → API Key tab → Account callback section**.
2. Enter your webhook URL (HTTPS required).
3. Click **Save** button.

## Receiving Events

Once your Account webhook is configured, Lumin will automatically send **HTTP POST requests** to your endpoint when events occur.

Account webhooks receive all supported event types across your entire Workspace. For a complete list of available events, see [Supported event types](/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-overview#supported-event-types).

All webhook events follow a consistent JSON structure. For detailed payload examples, see [Event payload structure](/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-overview#event-payload-structure).


### Event delivery rules

- **One request per event**: Each event triggers a separate HTTP POST request
- **Real-time delivery**: Events are delivered as they occur
- **Workspace-wide coverage**: All events triggered by any API keys in your Workspace
- **No filtering**: You receive all event types - there's no opt-out mechanism


## Verify the webhook
Lumin provides a couple of headers on Webhook requests:

**User-Agent**: Sender agent. Always `Lumin Sign API`

**X-Signature**: A hex digest SHA256 signature of the request's JSON payload, generated using your [Primary API key](/docs/api/authentication/#multiple-api-keys)

**Verification steps**:
1. Read the `X-Signature` header.
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256 with your **Primary API key**.
3. Compare securely with the header value.
4. Reject if mismatch or timestamp expired.

**Example**:
```bash
api_key='my_primary_api_key'
json='{"event": { "event_time": 1694664207595, "event_type": "signature_request_sent" }, "signature_request": { "signature_request_id": "fa5c8a0b0f492d768749333ad6fcc214c111e967", "title": "My first request" } }'

echo -n $json | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $api_key (X-Signature = 3810cb411041efab279d31698b9584372e5ede9d1641fbb354810f16e51be81c)
```

## Respond to Events

Your webhook endpoint must respond appropriately to ensure reliable event delivery:

#### Success response
- **Return HTTP 200 OK** to acknowledge successful receipt
- **Respond within 30 seconds** to avoid timeout
- **No specific response body required** - empty response is acceptable

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

#### Error handling
- **HTTP 4xx/5xx responses** will trigger retry attempts
- **Timeout responses** (>30 seconds) will be retried
- **Connection failures** will be retried with exponential backoff

For detailed retry schedules and failure handling, see [Retry rules and failure handling](/docs/api/webhooks/webhook-overview#retry-rules-and-failure-handling).
