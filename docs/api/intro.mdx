The Lumin API documentation provides information and examples for working with Luminâ€™s suite of APIs. You can use these APIs to build document workflows including editing, signing, and automation.

The Lumin API is REST-based, with predictable resource-oriented URLs. It uses standard HTTP methods, response codes, authentication, and request formats to ensure consistency and ease of integration.
