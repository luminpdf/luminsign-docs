### January 10, 2024
To enhance the flexibility of the Signature Request process, two new parameters have been introduced:

1. `signing_type`:
  This parameter allows you to specify the signing order for the Signature Request. It accepts two possible values:
  - `SAME_TIME`: All signers can sign the document simultaneously.
  - `ORDER`: Signers must sign the document in a specified order.
2. `group`:
  When the `signing_type` is set to `ORDER`, you must use the group parameter to specify the group of signers who need to sign in the defined order.

For more information, see [Send Signature Request](/api/send-signature-request).
### December 19, 2023
#### Added
- Add `signature_request_created` and `signature_request_invalid` events to [Signature Request Events](/docs/api/events/#event-names).

### December 6, 2023
#### Added
- Add webhook support for signature request events. For more information about supported events, see [Signature Request Events](/docs/api/events/#event-names).

For more information about events and callbacks, see [Events](/docs/api/events/).

### November 8, 2023
#### Added
- Add `use_text_tags` parameter to [Send Signature Request](/api/send-signature-request) to enable text tags in the document. For more information, see [Text Tags](/docs/api/walkthrough/text-tag/).

To begin and end a tag, use square brackets `[ ]` in your document. Within the square brackets, use the pipe character `|` to divide the parts of the tag. The first part of the tag is the type. The second part indicates if it is required or not. The third part indicates which signer in the list of signers needs to complete the field. The last two parts are optional and are for setting a label and unique ID
ex: [text|noreq|signer1|Label|UniqueId]
#### Fixed
- Some minor issues related to signers list and signer name in signature request.
