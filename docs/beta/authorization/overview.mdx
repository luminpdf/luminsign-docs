# Authentication overview

## Overview

Before your app can access Lumin data or interact with Lumin APIs, you need to authenticate your requests.

Lumin currently supports the following authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication
- Simple to set up, intended for server-to-server communication.
- Issued by Workspace Owners via the Lumin Developer Setting page.
- Best suited for trusted backend jobs, cron tasks, or integrations without user involvement.

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow
- Recommended for applications where end-users need to grant access to their Lumin data.
- Provides granular permissions via **scopes**.
- Supports two client types:
  - **Public Application (with PKCE)** – for mobile apps, SPAs, and desktop apps that cannot safely store secrets.
  - **Private/Server Application** – for secure servers that can keep client secrets safe.

## Choosing the right method

| Use case | Recommended method |
|----------|-------------------|
| Scheduled backend job (no user interaction) | API Key or OAuth 2.0 Private Authorization Code |
| Web app where users sign in and provide consent | OAuth 2.0 Private Authorization Code |
| Mobile/SPA app | OAuth 2.0 Public Authorization Code with PKCE |
| Quick testing | API Key |
