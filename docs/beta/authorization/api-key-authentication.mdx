# API Key Authentication

## Overview

API Keys allow you to authenticate by including a key with each request. They are simple to use and are best suited for **server-to-server integrations** or **quick testing**.

- API keys are **long-lived** and do not expire automatically.
- Treat keys as secrets - they provide full access within their permissions.

## How to get an API Key

1. Log in to Lumin as a **Workspace Owner** or **Workspace Admin**.
2. Go to **Settings → Developer Settings → API Keys**.
3. Click **Generate key**.
4. Copy and securely store the key.

:::warning
**Important:** API keys should be treated like passwords. Do not share them or commit them to source control.

## Example usage

You can authenticate in two ways:

### 1. Using `X-API-KEY` header

```bash
API_KEY=my_simple_api_key
curl -X GET "https://api.luminpdf.com/v1/user/info" \
    -H "X-API-KEY: ${API_KEY}"
```

### 2. Using HTTP Basic Auth

Provide your API key as the **username** in Basic Auth (no password required). Don't forget the trailing `:`.

```bash
API_KEY=my_simple_api_key
curl -X GET "https://api.luminpdf.com/v1/user/info" \
    -u "${API_KEY}:"
```

## Multiple API Keys

- Each account can have up to **4 API keys** active at a time.
- All keys are valid and can be used in parallel.
- One key can be marked as the **Primary Key**. The Primary Key is used to generate **signatures** for [verifying Account webhook event payloads](../api/events).

## Rotating API Keys

- To rotate, generate a new key from the **Developer settings** page.
- Old keys will continue to work until you delete them.
- Always confirm the new key works before deactivating old ones.
- If you change the **Primary Key**, ensure your webhook signature verification logic is updated.

:::info
**When to rotate keys:**
- At least every **6 months** (recommended).
- Immediately, if exposure or compromise is suspected.

## Best practices

- Store keys in a secret manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Rotate keys periodically.
- Never embed keys in mobile apps or client-side code.
- Use API keys only for **trusted backend integrations** where OAuth 2.0 is not required.
- Always verify new keys work before deleting old ones.
