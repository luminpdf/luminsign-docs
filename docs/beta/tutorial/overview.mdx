The Lumin Sign integration allows you to launch a fully-compliant digital signing flow from your web or mobile application in a few easy steps. At a high-level you will:

1. Display a Lumin Sign start page to your customer
2. Create a new Lumin Sign document by calling the API
3. Display the document setup flow to the customer in an iframe

Once you have loaded the Lumin Sign iframe, Lumin Sign will take care of the rest. The document will be emailed to signers and Lumin Sign will facilitate the signing process. Your application can track the progress of the signing workflow via the Lumin Sign API. The completed document can be downloaded via the API.
