Install client library on any page that a user might sign in on. Use the following code snippet:

```js
<script src="https://script.luminpdf.com/client-beta.js" async defer></script>
````

:::caution
This is the beta script for testing only. This script will be updated later when release in production
:::

You can optimize your page's loading speed if you load the script with the ```async``` and ```defer``` boolean attributes.
