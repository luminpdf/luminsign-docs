# Connecting to Lumin MCP

Learn how to get started and plug Lumin into your AI tool.

This guide walks you through connecting your AI tool to Lumin using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Once connected, your tool can request live context from a user’s Lumin based on their access and permissions.

## Connect through your AI tool

We are providing a Streamable HTTP protocol for Lumin MCP. You can use this protocol to connect your AI tool to Lumin.

To connect, search for "Lumin MCP" in your tool's MCP directory or use the following connection method:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Lumin": {
      "url": "https://mcp.luminpdf.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If you're experiencing issues connecting your AI tool to Lumin MCP, here are some common solutions:

**1. Confirm MCP Client Compatibility**: ensure your AI tool includes built-in MCP client functionality and can connect to MCP servers. Not all tools currently offer this capability.

**2. Check Remote Server Connectivity**: some AI tools support MCP clients but cannot connect to remote servers.

**3. Ask for MCP Support if Needed**: if your AI tool lacks MCP support entirely, consider contacting its developers to request MCP server integration. Encouraging broader MCP compatibility helps strengthen the overall ecosystem.
